ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oleksii.

  - I am a self-taught programmer interested in math, Python programming, and learning related technologies.

  - I am focused on expanding my skills in server-side technologies, machine learning, and analytics.
  My interests lie in:
    - Database management.
    - Data manupulation and visualization.
    - Containerization technologies.
    - Web server administration, with a specific focus on NGINX and Apache.
  - Furthermore, I am drawn to the intricate domains of data manipulation,
  visualization techniques, and machine learning algorithms.
  - I recognize the complexity of these subjects and understand
  the pivotal role of mathematics in comprehending and mastering them. Therefore, I am also actively engaged in studying
  mathematics, acknowledging its indispensability in grasping the intricacies of machine learning and analytics.
  Although mathematics was a huge fear long ago, now this engagement, personally to me, is akin to reading a book or coding.

  - In my opinion, regardless of the enormity of the goals set, they are achievable with time,
  persistence, and unwavering dedication. Consistency and perseverance are key factors that pave the path to success,
  allowing one to overcome obstacles towards the desired outcome.
